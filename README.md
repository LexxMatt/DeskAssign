This repository contains supplementary material for the paper “Comparative Evaluation of Object Detection Models for Workstation Recognition in Architectural Floor Plans”.
Due to space constraints, the paper includes only Tables 1–5 and Figures 1–3.
The complete Section 5 results breakdown is provided here, including:
(i) density-level evaluation tables (test set composition, mAP@50, precision, recall), and
(ii) supporting result figures comparing model performance across All, High-Density, Medium-Density, and Low-Density subsets.
These materials support the density-specific and density-weighted comparisons summarized in the paper.
